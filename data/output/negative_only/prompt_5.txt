Impressionist oil painting. A quiet café interior during a rainy afternoon, a steaming cup on a small table near a window with raindrops. Medium shot, painterly brush strokes, soft edges, warm amber interior lighting contrasting cool blue-gray rain outside. Gentle atmosphere, rich texture, fine-art feel.
