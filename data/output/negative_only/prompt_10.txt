Retro-futurism illustration, 1960s magazine cover aesthetic. An optimistic remote-work scene: a person at a sleek mid-century desk with a futuristic screen showing a video call, stylized city skyline outside. Bold shapes, halftone texture, warm vintage palette, clean composition, charming and upbeat.
