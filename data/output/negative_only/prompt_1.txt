Ultra-photorealistic portrait photography. A lighthouse keeper in a weathered wool sweater standing on a rocky Atlantic coastline at dawn, calm confident expression. Medium close-up, 85mm lens, shallow depth of field, crisp skin texture, subtle sea spray in the air. Soft golden backlight with gentle rim light, natural color grading, cinematic realism, high detail.
